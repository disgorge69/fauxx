 * - Third-party cookies accepted (needed for tracker accumulation)
 * - DOM storage enabled
 * - Local file/content access denied (the pool only ever loads remote http(s) URLs)
 *
 * Cookie / storage isolation (finding #4): this pool is the only WebView in the Fauxx process,
 * and its cookies + DOM storage live in Fauxx's own WebView data directory — set once at app
 * startup via `WebView.setDataDirectorySuffix("fauxx_phantom")` (API 28+; see
 * [com.fauxx.FauxxApp]) — separate from the platform-default WebView store. The user's real
 * browser is a different app in a different process and shares no WebView state with Fauxx. The
 * two pooled instances intentionally share this store so trackers accumulate across reuse;
 * per-instance cookie jars are not an Android primitive (`CookieManager` is process-global) and
 * are not wanted here.
 *
 * All WebViews use [PhantomWebViewClient] which blocks blocklisted domains.
 *
 * Pool size was reduced from 3 to 2 in v0.3.0 when the scraper-reserved slot was
 * retired alongside the in-app Layer 2 scraper (issue #52). AdPollution + Cookie
 * + DiverseBrowsing modules share the remaining slots; concurrent acquires block
 * via [poolSemaphore].
