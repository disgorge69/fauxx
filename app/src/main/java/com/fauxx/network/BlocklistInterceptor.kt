/**
 * Fail-closed blocklist gate for the OkHttp path. Every request made through the
 * injected [OkHttpClient] flows through this interceptor, so no module can issue an
 * HTTP request to a blocked host even if a future call site forgets an upstream
 * check. NOTE (#183): post-M1 no engine module currently issues OkHttp requests, so
 * this gate has no live traffic today; it remains the enforced chokepoint for any
 * future OkHttp consumer. The WebView path is gated separately by
 * [com.fauxx.engine.webview.PhantomWebViewClient]; together these are the single
 * enforced chokepoints for the blocklist invariant (issue #165).
 *
 * [DomainBlocklist.isBlocked] fails closed (returns true for every host) when the
 * blocklist could not be loaded, so a load failure halts HTTP traffic rather than
 * letting it through unchecked.
